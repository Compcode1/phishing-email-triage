This mock case study of a phishing-based credential theft attack illustrates how user deception, rather than malware, often opens the door to serious cloud compromises.

It reinforces that:

Phishing triage needs structured steps (artifact isolation ➔ URL inspection ➔ authentication validation ➔ exposure analysis ➔ containment).

Cloud triage (SaaS platforms) requires tight log review — traditional endpoint forensics alone is insufficient.

The human factor (awareness gaps) and missing technical controls (MFA) often combine to turn small mistakes into large breaches.

Practicing systematic social engineering triage, understanding phishing artifacts, and recognizing cloud-focused attack progression prepares cybersecurity professionals for real-world incident response far beyond textbook examples.
